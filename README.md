Assessing the Severity of Service Failures Through Social Chatter
================

## Abstract

Firms employ a variety of passive listening platforms (e.g., customer
comment cards, help lines, social media) that elicit a variety of
complaints. Since these complaints are self-selected, it isnâ€™t obvious
if complaints are widespread or genuinely indicative of systemic service
failures. In other words, how can can a firm know when complaints can be
ignored and when they need to addressed? This issue is related to a
larger class of problems where the goal is to make inference about the
size of a population from a non-random sample (e.g., the German tank
problem). In this paper, we develop a model that uses a variety of
observed customer complaints on Twitter to make inference about the
severity of service failures.
