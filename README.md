Using social media to assess the severity of service failures.

## Getting Started
* Unlimited private repositories are available for students and academics: https://education.github.com.
* GitHub Guides is a good place to get familiar with how to use the platform: https://guides.github.com.

## Code Collaboration
The [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) is straightforward enough, but how it integrates with R and RStudio is something I'm still figuring out. I'll provide more guidance at a future date, but here's what I'm using to walk through this process:

* Hadley Wickham's *R Packages* book: http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html.
* Happy Git and GitHub for the useR: http://happygitwithr.com.
