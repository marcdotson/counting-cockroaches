## Getting Started
* Unlimited private repositories are available for students and academics: https://education.github.com.
* GitHub Guides is a good place to get familiar with how to use the platform: https://guides.github.com.

## Code Collaboration for R/RStudio
The [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) is straightforward enough, but how it integrates with R and RStudio is something I'm still figuring out. I'll provide more guidance at a future date, but here's what I'm using to walk through this process:

* Hadley Wickham's *R Packages* book: http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html.
* Happy Git and GitHub for the useR: http://happygitwithr.com.

# Connecting RStudio to GitHub
## Prerequisites
* Install/update R & RStudio
* Install Git (see next section)

## Installing Git
### Windows
* Download Git for Windows at https://git-for-windows.github.io/
* You can accept all the default settings during installation.
* Note: RStudio for windows likes for git to be in the Files(x86) folder. If not in this location, RStudio may not detect it, and may cause headaches for you later.
### Mac OS
* Download Git for Mac OS at http://git-scm.com/downloads
