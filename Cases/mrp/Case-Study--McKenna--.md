Multi-level regression and post-stratification helps to infer treatment
size for a whole population from a non-representative sample. Using
population knowledge samples are classified into cells based off of
chosen classification variables. Hierarchical Bayesian models are used
to infer(?) treatment within cells and population knowledge is used to
weight each cell according to their prevalence within the total
population. Multilevel regression and poststratification (Gelman &
Little, 1997) proceeds by fitting a hierarchical regression model to
survey data, and then using the population size of each
poststratification cell to construct weighted survey estimates. The
accuracy of poststratification within MRP can be dependent on whehter
the matrix that is used in poststratification is an accurate
representation of the target population. This combination of MRP and
postsrtatification has been seen as an effective method when adjusting a
sample to be more representative of a population for specific variables.

## Data

Categorical classification variables are chosen and cell are assigned
baised off of category classification. For example, if one variable is
gender consisting of two categories (male and other) and one variable is
age consisting of two categories (0-50 and 50-100) then there would be
four cells: male 0-50, male 50-100, other 0-50, and other 50-100.

In this case study there are five classification variables choosen: age,
income, ethnicity, gender, and state. Each variable is transformed into
categorical variables with age having seven categories, income having
three, ethnicity having three, gender having two, and state have 50
making the total number of cells 6,300 (7 x 3 x 3 x 2 x 50 = 6300).

Data is generated using a function used in case study (noted in
references)

## Model

This case study will use generated data. The data is broken up into
three data tables: sample, post-stratification, and population. The
post-stratification table shows the population density of each cell and
is used to weight the outcome results from the sample. Because the data
is generated we also have a generated population that we can use to
check the accuracy of the model.

First we will build a model to generate parameter estimates for each
cell. Then we will use the post-stratification table to correctly weight
the estimates for the whole population.

We will use Bayesian hierarchical modeling to take advantage of partial
pooling to account for empty cells.

### McKennaâ€™s logit model

``` r
predictors <- sample %>% 
  select(male, age, eth, income, state)

data_list <- list(
  D = 5,                                              # Number of variables. 
  N = 1200,                                           # Number of observations.
  L = 5,                                              # Number of groups. 
  y = sample$service_failure,                         # Outcome variables. 
  ll = sample(5, 1200, replace = TRUE),               # Group assignment. 
  x = predictors                                      # Matrix of predictors. 
)
```

``` r
fit <- stan(
  file = here::here("Code", "mrp", "logit_hier.stan"),
  data = data_list,
  seed = 42 
)
```

#### Downes logit model

``` r
# Observations. 
downes_list <- list(
  outcome = sample$service_failure,
  male = sample$male + 1,
  age = sample$age, 
  eth = sample$eth, 
  income = sample$income,
  state = sample$state,
  n = length(sample$service_failure), 
  n_male = max(sample$male) + 1,
  n_age = max(sample$age),
  n_eth = max(sample$eth),
  n_income = max(sample$income),
  n_state = max(sample$state)
)
```

``` r
fit <- stan(
  file = here::here("Code", "mrp", "downes_copy.stan"),
  data = downes_list,
  seed = 42 
)
```

#### Stan user guide logit model

``` r
stan_data <- list( 
  age = sample$age, 
  eth = sample$eth, 
  income = sample$income, 
  male = sample$male, 
  state = sample$state, 
  Y = sample$service_failure, 
  N = length(sample$service_failure)
)
```

``` r
fit <- stan(
  file = here::here("Code", "mrp", "stan_mrp.stan"),
  data = stan_data,
  seed = 42 
)
```

## Post-Stratification

Post-stratification consists of taking the sum of the estimates of the
model for each cell times the number of people in each cell divided by
the total number of people. Using poststratificationcan immprove accracy
of the estimates based on the information
known.

\[\omega=\displaystyle\frac{\]*{j=1}^{J}*{j}\*N\_{j}\[}{\]*{j=1}^{J}N*{j}\[}\]
Post-stratification can be performed in stan using the generated
quantities block.

``` r
generated quantities {
  real expect_pos = 0;
  int total = 0;
  for (b in 1:7)
    for (c in 1:3)
      for (d in 1:3)
        for (f in 1:2)
          for (g in 1:50) {
        total += P[b, c, d, f, g];
        expect_pos
          += P[b, c, d, f, g]
             * inv_logit(b0 + a_age[b] + a_eth[c] + a_income[d] + a_male[f] + a_state[g]);
      }
  real<lower = 0, upper = 1> phi = expect_pos / total;
}           
```

## Compare to Population

Because we are using simulated data we can see how our poststratified
predictions compare to the true population.
