Code
================

## Description

Each script should do something specific (like tidyverse functions),
have a descriptive name, and include number prefixes if they are meant
to be run in a certain order (e.g., `01_import_data.R`,
`02_clean_data.R`).

## Project Workflow

  - Use RStudio projects.
  - Use `here::here()` to specify files paths.
  - Use tidyverse functions as much as possible.
  - Try and follow the [tidyverse style
    guide](https://style.tidyverse.org).
